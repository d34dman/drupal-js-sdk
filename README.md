**This Project is in a very early phase of its development. Things are very volatile and evolving.**


**Drupal JavaScript SDK** is an SDK for JavaScript developers for creating applications that connect to a Drupal backend.

You can benefit from this SDK if you are developing a JavaScript application that:

- Connects to a Decoupled Drupal Application
- Authenticates with Drupal 
- Use experimental features of the decoupled menu
- Handle error messages while interacting with Drupal more gracefully
- Can use some guides and API that can help you with many common scenarios

This project feature overlaps with a lot of other open-source projects. The primary goal of this SDK would be to treat guides and examples as first-class citizen and not as an afterthought.
