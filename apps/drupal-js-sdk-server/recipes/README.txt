Recipes allow the automation of Drupal module and theme installation and
configuration.

WHAT TO PLACE IN THIS DIRECTORY?
--------------------------------

Placing downloaded and custom recipes in this directory separates downloaded and
custom recipes from Drupal core's recipes. This allows Drupal core to be updated
without overwriting these files.
